An information hub for progressive non-profit organizations

## Deatils
  -Using a carousel I added powerful imagery to illustrate the issues addressed in the site.
  -Each topic has its own dedicated panel containing modals and links to the premire non-profit organizations in that field.
  -Once a link is clicked, a modal opens, showing a brief description of the organization as well as a direct link to the full site.
  -At the bottom of the site is a live twitter feed, which follows most of the organizations contained in the panels for real time updates    and ingformation.
  -Lastly is the image for the 'Indivisible' movement as well as a brief description and direct link to that site.
